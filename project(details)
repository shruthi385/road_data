# Abstract

## Project Title: Delay and Cost Overrun Prediction in Infrastructure Projects

### Background:
Infrastructure projects are often plagued by delays and cost overruns, leading to significant financial losses and project inefficiencies. Predicting these delays and cost overruns in advance can help project managers take proactive measures to mitigate risks and ensure timely completion within budget constraints.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop predictive models and an interactive dashboard that can accurately forecast project delays and cost overruns in infrastructure projects. The models leverage historical project data and employ machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights.

### Methodology:
1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Datasets containing historical project information, including start and end dates, planned and actual costs, project scope, and other relevant features, were collected.
   - Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values, feature engineering, and data transformation to ensure the quality and consistency of the data.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Key features such as construction period, time taken for completion, scheduled time for completion, and delay period were calculated.
   - Delay periods were converted to months and years for better understanding.
   - Cost-related features were also derived to predict cost overruns.

3. **Model Development:**
   - **Delay Prediction Model:**
     - A RandomForestRegressor model was trained to predict delay periods based on features like construction period, stretch distance, and lane configuration.
   - **Cost Overrun Prediction Model:**
     - A RandomForestRegressor model was trained to predict cost overruns using features such as project budget, actual costs, and project scope.
   - The models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and other relevant metrics to ensure accuracy.

4. **Dashboard Implementation:**
   - An interactive dashboard was created using Streamlit to allow users to upload project data, visualize key metrics, and make predictions.
   - Various visualizations, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and histograms, were used to provide insights into project performance.
   - Time series forecasting was implemented using Prophet to predict future delays.
   - The dashboard includes a feature to generate customizable PDF reports containing key metrics, visualizations, and predictions for project delays and cost overruns.

### Results:
The developed models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting project delays and cost overruns. The interactive dashboard provided an intuitive interface for project managers to explore data, visualize trends, and make informed decisions. The ability to generate detailed PDF reports added significant value by allowing stakeholders to review and communicate findings effectively.

### Conclusion:
This project successfully developed a comprehensive solution for predicting delays and cost overruns in infrastructure projects. By leveraging machine learning techniques and interactive visualizations, the project provides valuable tools for project managers to enhance project planning and execution, ultimately leading to more efficient and cost-effective project management.
